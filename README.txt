Original code written by Leo Medina 2015, adapted by Nathan Titus 2022

This code was based off of the "MRG" Fiber Model described in:

McIntyre CC, Richardson AG, and Grill WM. Modeling the excitability of
mammalian nerve fibers: influence of afterpotentials on the recovery
cycle. Journal of Neurophysiology 87:995-1006, 2002.

This code was run using: 
NEURON 7.7 (with python)
Python 3

Simmulations for Gilbert et al were run using the resources of the Duke Computing Cluster.

This code was run in a linux environment but could be run on other platforms.

To run this code:
1. You will need to have installed NEURON and Python
2. Compile the .mod files in the mechanisms folder and add the resulting dll file to the main directory.
3. Use RunDCFiber.py to run the simulations.
4. The variables instantiated with command line arguments should match one of the voltage distribution files.
